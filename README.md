Bludot OS
=========

This is an online Operating System that has been worked on for the last two years. It has been inspired by the huge space that an operating system takes today and the extra needed tools for an OS do to tasks. This OS is being released at the end of August. We are in desperate need of developers. There is a developer center on the OS for developers to create amazing apps. This is o fcourse open source and all code is available at https://github.com/bludot/BluDotOS.
