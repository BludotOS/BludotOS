BluDotOS
========

An Online Operating System

Started in August 2011 and has advanced to a advanced web application. It is mainly based on Ajax. Whatever is "run" on this OS is written in Javascript. All php files only handle permissons and server side functions. Docs have not yet been created but a sneak peak to the DevCenter is avaliable at: http://dev.bludotos.com or http://dev.bludot.tk

Note: The avaliable DevCenter API is not current although the version will still work in the OS
